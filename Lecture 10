Static Variables:
Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.
They are initialized only once, at the start of the execution, and are common to all instances of the class.
They are declared using the static keyword.
Static Methods:
Static methods belong to the class rather than to any specific instance.
They can be called directly using the class name, without the need to create an instance of the class.
They cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly, as they are not associated with any instance.
Static Blocks:
Static blocks are used to initialize static variables.
They are executed only once, when the class is loaded into memory.
They are declared using the static keyword and enclosed within curly braces {}.
Example of Static Variables, Methods, and Blocks:
java
Copy code
public class MyClass {
    // Static variable
    static int staticVar = 10;

    // Instance variable
    int instanceVar;

    // Static block
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block executed");
        // Initialize static variables
        staticVar = 20;
    }

    // Static method
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method called");
        // Cannot access instanceVar directly as it is not associated with any instance
        // System.out.println("Instance variable: " + instanceVar); // Compilation Error
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Accessing static variable and method directly using class name
        System.out.println("Static variable: " + MyClass.staticVar);
        MyClass.staticMethod();

        // Creating objects of MyClass
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();
        MyClass obj2 = new MyClass();

        // Accessing instance variable
        obj1.instanceVar = 5;
        obj2.instanceVar = 10;

        // Accessing instance variable using objects
        System.out.println("Instance variable of obj1: " + obj1.instanceVar);
        System.out.println("Instance variable of obj2: " + obj2.instanceVar);
    }
}
In this example:

staticVar is a static variable shared among all instances of the class.
The static block initializes the static variables when the class is loaded into memory.
staticMethod() is a static method called directly using the class name.
Instance variables instanceVar are specific to each instance of the class and can be accessed using objects of the class.

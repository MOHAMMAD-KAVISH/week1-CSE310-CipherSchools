Stack:
The stack is a region of memory used for method calls and local variables.
Each thread in a Java program has its own stack.
When a method is called, a new stack frame is created, which contains parameters, local variables, and return address.
The stack operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.
Heap:
The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
Objects in Java are allocated memory on the heap.
All objects reside in the heap, regardless of how they are created (e.g., using the new keyword or as part of an array).
Memory in the heap is managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using garbage collection algorithms.
The heap operates in a more complex manner than the stack, with memory allocation and deallocation occurring at different times.
Example:
Here's an example demonstrating the difference between stack and heap in Java:

java
Copy code
public class StackHeapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Stack variables
        int stackVar1 = 10;
        int stackVar2 = 20;

        // Heap objects
        String str1 = new String("Hello"); // String object allocated on the heap
        String str2 = "World"; // String literal also resides in the heap

        // Printing stack variables
        System.out.println("Stack Variable 1: " + stackVar1);
        System.out.println("Stack Variable 2: " + stackVar2);

        // Printing heap objects
        System.out.println("Heap Object 1: " + str1);
        System.out.println("Heap Object 2: " + str2);
    }
}
In this example:

stackVar1 and stackVar2 are variables allocated on the stack.
str1 and str2 are objects allocated on the heap. While str2 is a string literal and directly resides in the string pool, str1 is created using the new keyword and is explicitly allocated memory on the heap.
Understanding the distinction between stack and heap memory is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free Java programs.
